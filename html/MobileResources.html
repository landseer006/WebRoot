        <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion">Android Motion Sensors </a><br />
        The Android platform provides several sensors that let you monitor the motion of a device. Motion sensors are useful for monitoring device movement, such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing. The movement is usually a reflection of direct user input (for example, a user steering a car in a game or a user controlling a ball in a game), but it can also be a reflection of the physical environment in which the device is sitting (for example, moving with you while you drive your car). In the first case, you are monitoring motion relative to the device's frame of reference or your application's frame of reference; in the second case you are monitoring motion relative to the world's frame of reference. Motion sensors by themselves are not typically used to monitor device position, but they can be used with other sensors, such as the geomagnetic field sensor, to determine a device's position relative to the world's frame of reference. <br />

        The Android platform provides two sensors that let you determine the position of a device: the geomagnetic field sensor and the accelerometer. The Android platform also provides a sensor that lets you determine how close the face of a device is to an object (known as the proximity sensor). The geomagnetic field sensor and the proximity sensor are hardware-based. Most handset and tablet manufacturers include a geomagnetic field sensor. Likewise, handset manufacturers usually include a proximity sensor to determine when a handset is being held close to a user's face (for example, during a phone call). For determining a device's orientation, you can use the readings from the device's accelerometer and the geomagnetic field sensor.<br />

        <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_environment">Android Environment Sensors</a><br />
        The Android platform provides four sensors that let you monitor various environmental properties. You can use these sensors to monitor relative ambient humidity, illuminance, ambient pressure, and ambient temperature near an Android-powered device. All four environment sensors are hardware-based and are available only if a device manufacturer has built them into a device. With the exception of the light sensor, which most device manufacturers use to control screen brightness, environment sensors are not always available on devices. Because of this, it's particularly important that you verify at runtime whether an environment sensor exists before you attempt to acquire data from it.<br />

        The coolest interface tricks that the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch can perform — from dimming a phone screen when it's held up to your head to undoing an action by shaking the device and more — are thanks to the sensors built into those devices. Without these sensors, none of the devices would work the ways we know and love.<br />
